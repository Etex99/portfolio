# MS Project

Unity 3D game prototype with AR elements and location-based gameplay. 

## The Project

The project target was to design and develop a serious game to help students seek healthier indoor air at the University of Oulu Linnanmaa campus. A prototype was developed for our customer, Ikune Labs, as part of the "R&D Project"- course included in the Master of Information Processing Science degree programme.

The team consisted of 4 students including myself.

My roles were lead game designer and developer.

## Key Results

* Novel game design for a serious game related to indoor air quality.
* A functional prototype developed with Unity 3D game engine.

Unfortunately this Git repository is private. 
You may view footage of the prototype via this [link to a shared Mp4 file on Google Drive.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16wGT755DbYcSrU631NnRa2E02A-QaAmj/view?usp=sharing).
Bear in mind the idle nature of the game and that the app is running on a weak budget phone. It is slow and boring to watch.
